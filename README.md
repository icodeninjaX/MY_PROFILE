# Hey, I'm iCodeNinjaEx 👋

**Full-Stack Web Developer** · Building practical tools that solve real problems.

I code with logic but think with depth — balancing technical craft with an understanding of the people who use what I build.

---

### What I Work With

**Core Stack**  
PHP · MySQL · JavaScript · HTML5 · Bootstrap 4

**Currently Exploring**  
React · Next.js · Supabase · Machine Learning Integration

---

### What I've Built

- **Production Systems** — POS platforms, e-commerce solutions, and internal business tools
- **Real-Time Applications** — Device monitoring dashboards with GPS tracking, SMS gateway systems
- **Current Project** — An ML-powered overlay app for real-time game analysis

I focus on shipping working tools, not just writing code. If it doesn't solve a real problem, it doesn't leave my desk.

### Beyond the Code

I have a background in **psychology** and a deep interest in human behavior — how people think, decide, and connect. I believe understanding users at a human level leads to better systems.

I'm also fascinated by **astronomy** — it's a good reminder that we're small enough to stay humble, yet capable enough to build remarkable things.

### How I Work

- **Fundamentals first.** I'd rather understand deeply than move fast and break things.
- **Quality over speed.** Sustainable solutions beat quick fixes.
- **Honest collaboration.** I value transparency and genuine connection over transactional exchanges.

### Let's Connect

I'm always open to meaningful conversations — whether it's about development, psychology, or the universe.
